### Notes
  
The [[Catholic Camarilla]] Prince, who is absolutely convinced he is in charge of Granada because of the events of 1492, though he quite thoroughly lacks the power pull that Prince [[Maram al-Rashid]] commands. Incidentally, he has very little territorial control and is kept firmly in check by Mel Averis who has more than once threatened to march into his Elysium and send him packing if he didn't cut the nonsense.
