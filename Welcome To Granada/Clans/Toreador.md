# Toreador
## Overview
The Degenerates are responsible for the legends of vampires who seduce and entice their prey with beauty, love and sensuality. Famous and infamous as a clan of artists and innovators, they are one of the bastions of the [[Camarilla]], as their very survival depends on the facades of civility and grace on which the sect prides itself.
