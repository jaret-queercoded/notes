Â Greetings, my fine coterie members!

I have recently heard of your appearance in my humble city, and I am disappointed that I have not met all of yet. One of my people has seen you all moving about the city, and I must insist upon your appearance in my court of Elysium so we may finally meet each other. I'm sure that you are as curious to meet me as I am you.

I understand that we are all busy people, and busy people have things that they always must tend to before they can officially set up a meeting. As a result, I think it best that you attend my next major court meeting: 5 November 2021.

Do make sure you bring an offering. I accept gifts of cash and lavish goods, and I do have a penchant for expensive art if you happen to know a Toreador or two.

I look forward to seeing your wonderful faces.

Sincerely,

[[Armando de Majorca]]
