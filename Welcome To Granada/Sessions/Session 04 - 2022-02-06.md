## Session Summary
[[Giacomo Fiori]] staked out a group of [[Gangrel]] thugs because his contact informed him that the finger print was found from [[Anitta Growler]]. It was most likely not the correct group of [[Gangrel]] because [[Anitta Growler]] is a anarch and this group was [[Camarilla]]. They then went and meet with their childer and they are going to go and work out of town for a while and didn't want to worry [[Giacomo Fiori]].
[[Cecil Hallward]] meet with [[Cecilia]] at the art gallery and now thinks that they are not a threat. It does not seem to like [[Cecilia]] has a blood bond with [[Armando de Majorca]] she just happens to have her haven inside of [[Armando de Majorca]] territory. She doesn't really know anything about [[Hugo Torres]]. She then warned that there was going to be a raid on some thin blood tonight.
[[Annette Osterwick]] went hunting that night and tried to flirt with some lesbians by buying them drinks but that didn't really pan out. She bought [[Ada]] rat food.
We discussed what to do about the [[Anitta Growler]]. Trying to figure out how to stake out the apartment. Most likely we will just put up some cameras to watch the apartment complex.

## Recap of last session
[[Session 03 - 2022-01-30]]

The party investigated Hugo's apartment. We found some blood on some ripped jeans in the apartment. We also found a note that had a phone number on it that was the number of a college art student that was talking to Hugo about starting a internship. [[Giacomo Fiori]]found a finger print on the back of the back of the faucet and it appears that blood was washed in it. [[Cecil Hallward]] tasted the blood and couldn't confirm it was Hugo's. [[Cecil Hallward]] had a premonition that showed that Hugo is alive. [[Ada]] hacked into the security system and saw that 5 people broke into [[Hugo Torres Apartment]] and then saw a van leave and the plate was obscured. [[Ada]] and [[Giacomo Fiori]] went to see [[Adoracion]] and try and get information about [[Cecilia]]. It turns out that [[Adoracion]] asked [[Cecilia]] to look up information about us and that is why [[Cecil Hallward]] had the premonition about the information that she was writing down. We then told [[Adoracion]] the truth about why we were there while she was initially upset she calmed down. [[Annette Osterwick]] went to talk to [[Maram al-Rashid]] about stuff and [[Maram al-Rashid]] was upset that [[Annette Osterwick]] acted like she was open to the idea of working for [[Armando de Majorca]].

## Log
We start this session on 11/06. [[Giacomo Fiori]] starts the night by cracking into a blood bag, he then gets a call from his contact and the finger print was from an kindred [[Gangrel]] Anarch that is from London and had moved here a few days before fall of London. Her name is [[Anitta Growler]]. [[Giacomo Fiori]] is going to do some staking out in the north area and that is where the anarchs are and [[Armando de Majorca]] is near. His contact warns him to be carful because there has been a lot of ghoul activity in the area and that has alerted the [[Second Inquisition]] and that though they haven't started snatching people yet it might happen soon. During the first few hours of staking out [[Giacomo Fiori]] doesn't see anything suspicious. Around 11 [[Giacomo Fiori]] notices a small group of [[Gangrel]] and one of them appears to be limping the rest of the group tries to hid the limping one from view. [[Giacomo Fiori]] grabs a pistol and goes out to investigate the [[Gangrel]] haven.

[[Giacomo Fiori]] finds the injured person and it appears that he got injured by someone in [[Armando de Majorca]]'s court. His friends are giving him shit for getting hurt. He heads out after this.

Around midnight he gets a text from [[Luca]] and asks if he has time to meet around 1:30 and they plan to meet at [[Giacomo's Home Base]] because he wants to talk to [[Giacomo Fiori]].

Next we skip over to [[Ada]]. [[Ada]] gets into Anya phone. I see messages going back and forth from the two ips that I found in [[Sacromonte]] urgently talking to one another. I also intercept a shutdown signal to the tracker. [[Ada]] asks [[Curro]] for [[Hugo Torres]]'s banking information and he has the information since he helped setting it up for [[Hugo Torres]] for a mask. [[Ada]] then gets into [[Hugo Torres]] bank account on the day of his disappearance he made a withdrawal of a few hundred euros. This is not the money for the art supplies that [[Curro]] was procuring for him. After investigating the messages between the ips appear to be normal conversation. [[Ada]] then setups something to monitor this conversation between the two ips and to save all communication between the two. [[Ada]] then setups a dead man app for everyone they will have to help [[Annette Osterwick]] with installing it on their phone. [[Ada]] asked [[Annette Osterwick]] to pick up 50 pounds of rat feed.

[[Annette Osterwick]] contacts [[Maram al-Rashid]] with intentions of purchasing an apartment complex to use as a fa√ßade for kindred to crash there. It is going to take 3 to 4 weeks for this process to go through.

[[Annette Osterwick]] tries to go and find out anything she can about the [[Second Inquisition]] in our area from her underlings. As far as she could find out there in no real [[Second Inquisition]] activity in our domains.

[[Cecil Hallward]] sets up to meet with [[Cecilia]] at the studio. He found a book on hypnosis and grieving and took it to give to [[Cecilia]]. [[Cecilia]] doesn't work with [[Armando de Majorca]] and is not blood bonded to them. She tells us that the [[Second Inquisition]] found a conclave of thinbloods in the city. Tonight they are going to raid the conclave. [[Cecilia]] heard this from someone in [[Armando de Majorca]]'s court. They alerted the [[Second Inquisition]] to save face. She gives [[Cecil Hallward]] a book on art from tombs across Europe.

[[Giacomo Fiori]] got [[Anitta Growler]]'s address from his contact. [[Luca]] is gonna go to [[Majorca]] to deal with with something for [[Maram al-Rashid]] in an attempt to weaken [[Armando de Majorca]].

[[Cecil Hallward]] has premonition about the [[Second Inquisition]] and sees something that is happening in the newer part of the city. It isn't anyone that we know. The door gets kicked in and then the [[Second Inquisition]] floods in.

[[Ada]] finds out that [[Anitta Growler]] is using a mask but Anitta is her name and that we don't know what her mask is.
