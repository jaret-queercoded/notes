For the first sesssion the Coterie met [[Maram al-Rashid]] in a flash back to 2012. The prince told us to stay away from [[Armando de Majorca]] and as a group we agreed to do that. After a time skip we received [[Letter From Armando]] and after the group discussed with [[Maram al-Rashid]] we decided to give them a terrible gift.

## Recap of last session
This is our first session.

## Log

Set back in 2012 we are in Elysium we meet the [[Maram al-Rashid]] for the first time.
It is pretty boring at first and when we are about to leave we meet [[Maram al-Rashid]].

Apparently the party was thrown for us to get to know us after what happened in London.

[[Maram al-Rashid]] warns us that there another Camarilla member that is Catholic that thinks that he rules the city. Also they don't know that we are now in the city. She has been in a proxy war to try and get rid of each other and control the city, but they decided to have a truce in this troublesome time and we are not to associate with him. His name is [[Armando de Majorca]].

I tell [[Maram al-Rashid]] about my rat plan for low frequency rat mesh network and after it was explained in lay man terms I get the go ahead to do it. I do take note that there two Nosferatu that are on the same level as myself when it comes to technology. I was also offered technology help with this but I rejected the help.

[[Maram al-Rashid]] offered bagged blood to both [[Ada]] and [[Giacomo Fiori]] since we are baggers. 

[[Giacomo Fiori]] agrees to let me put a tracker in his car, a emergency button and a wifi pineapple.

[[Annette Osterwick]] and [[Cecil Hallward]] talk to a [[Toreador]] for a while and they talk about tindr and grindr and they agree that [[Annette Osterwick]] should make a profile to find lesbians.

[[Ada]] begins work an a system to monitor twitter for any mention of [[Armando de Majorca]] and just general weird vampire shit. Also begins works on a system that will track the local population to attempt to identify any persons that identify as a lesbian for [[Annette Osterwick]].

Post time skip [[Curro]] gives us a blank letter with a wax seal on the back with an A. [[Curro]] lets us know that the A is most likely from [[Armando de Majorca]] and states that is the only way that he sends his letters. The party received [[Letter From Armando]].

The party minus [[Ada]] goes to see [[Maram al-Rashid]] to tell them about the letter that was given to them.

[[Maram al-Rashid]] suggested that we should go to see [[Armando de Majorca]] and give him a terrible gift. Also [[Maram al-Rashid]] also noted that [[Armando de Majorca]] most likely didn't know about [[Ada]] and that it would best to keep it that way.
