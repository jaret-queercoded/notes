## Session Summary

## Recap of last session
[[Session 04 - 2022-02-06]]
[[Giacomo Fiori]] staked out a group of [[Gangrel]] thugs because his contact informed him that the finger print was found from [[Anitta Growler]]. It was most likely not the correct group of [[Gangrel]] because [[Anitta Growler]] is a anarch and this group was [[Camarilla]]. They then went and meet with their childer and they are going to go and work out of town for a while and didn't want to worry [[Giacomo Fiori]].
[[Cecil Hallward]] meet with [[Cecilia]] at the art gallery and now thinks that they are not a threat. It does not seem to like [[Cecilia]] has a blood bond with [[Armando de Majorca]] she just happens to have her haven inside of [[Armando de Majorca]] territory. She doesn't really know anything about [[Hugo Torres]]. She then warned that there was going to be a raid on some thin blood tonight.
[[Annette Osterwick]] went hunting that night and tried to flirt with some lesbians by buying them drinks but that didn't really pan out. She bought [[Ada]] rat food. Also [[Annette Osterwick]] is trying to buy an apartment complex.
We discussed what to do about the [[Anitta Growler]]. Trying to figure out how to stake out the apartment. Most likely we will just put up some cameras to watch the apartment complex.

## Log
[[Annette Osterwick]] goes hunting and tries to find the person that they bought drinks for the other night but she is unsuccessful in finding them. [[Annette Osterwick]] then goes to [[Armando de Majorca]] court for some reason I kind of lost why they are doing this. [[Arlette d'Avignon]] meets with [[Annette Osterwick]] but she is kind of confused as to why she would be coming to [[Armando de Majorca]] courts because of [[Armando de Majorca]]. Things didn't go as planned for [[Annette Osterwick]] and she doesn't really accomplish anything from this visit.

[[Ada]] saw an encrypted message go from the [[Sacromonte]] ip to an ip in [[Maram al-Rashid]] court. [[Anya]] was able to get an unredacted report for the raid that happened last night by the [[Second Inquisition]]. The operation name was [[Limbo Extraction]] and it was done by the [[Fourth Lateran Department 5]] and it was supervised by someone that Seph hasn't come up with a name. [[Ada]] then attempts to trace the ip of the person that received the message and it is from [[Maram al-Rashid]] court. After deliberation [[Ada]] decides that it is their best interest to not hack into [[Maram al-Rashid]]'s court to try and figure out who received the message and to hack into that person computer to unencrypt the message.

[[Lillian]] shows up at [[Cecil Hallward]] office and says that someone named [[Vivian Sterling]] was looking for [[Annette Osterwick]] and asking questions about [[Annette Osterwick]]. [[Cecil Hallward]] calls [[Annette Osterwick]] and she tells him that if [[Vivian Sterling]] and that they should dual them on sight. She tells him that he should tell [[Lillian]] to stay home and to not go out. But [[Lillian]] does seem to care what they think they should do and that they are hungry and that they are going to do what they want. 

[[Cecil Hallward]] has a vision about [[Hugo Torres]] and it appears that he is being held captive and that he is very bored but not afraid.

[[Ada]] hacks into the apartment complex of [[Anitta Growler]] and sets up access for [[Giacomo Fiori]] to access their vpn so that they will be able to monitor the cameras from where ever they are. 

[[Giacomo Fiori]] stakes out [[Anitta Growler's Apartment]] they wait for a few hours and then they show up even though they don't seem them leave. [[Anitta Growler]] is wearing a local grocery store uniform and appears to be putting on the airs of being tired like they are a human. This appears to be their cover and how they are getting money to survive.

When everyone meets back at the mansion [[Annette Osterwick]] storms in demanding that [[Ada]] looks up everything that they can about [[Vivian Sterling]]. [[Ada]] gets overwhelmed by being yelled at a little bit and asks not to be yelled at and when asked to not be yelled at [[Lillian]] gets upset that [[Annette Osterwick]] would apologize to [[Ada]] this causes [[Ada]] to break down. [[Annette Osterwick]] goes to apologize to [[Ada]] and they share a long and awkward hug.

[[Giacomo Fiori]] lets us know what they found about [[Anitta Growler]] and that we could ambush them coming home or something like that.

[[Vivian Sterling]] is [[Annette Osterwick]] sire and the reason that [[Annette Osterwick]] is freaking out because she at one point attempted to get rid of them and it appears that she has failed. 

[[Ada]] finds the most recent mask name is Gillian Beck. [[Ada]] has a full on breakdown thinking about setting up a honeypot and threating [[Vivian Sterling]] that if something happens to [[Annette Osterwick]] they would leak the information.

[[Annette Osterwick]] went to see [[Maram al-Rashid]] and ask about [[Vivian Sterling]]. [[Annette Osterwick]] goes home and cries.
