## Session Summary
The party investigated Hugo's apartment. We found some blood on some ripped jeans in the apartment. We also found a note that had a phone number on it that was the number of a college art student that was talking to Hugo about starting a internship. [[Giacomo Fiori]]found a finger print on the back of the back of the faucet and it appears that blood was washed in it. [[Cecil Hallward]] tasted the blood and couldn't confirm it was Hugo's. [[Cecil Hallward]] had a premonition that showed that Hugo is alive. [[Ada]] hacked into the security system and saw that 5 people broke into [[Hugo Torres Apartment]] and then saw a van leave and the plate was obscured. [[Ada]] and [[Giacomo Fiori]] went to see [[Adoracion]] and try and get information about [[Cecilia]]. It turns out that [[Adoracion]] asked [[Cecilia]] to look up information about us and that is why [[Cecil Hallward]] had the premonition about the information that she was writing down. We then told [[Adoracion]] the truth about why we were there while she was initially upset she calmed down. [[Annette Osterwick]] went to talk to [[Maram al-Rashid]] about stuff and [[Maram al-Rashid]] was upset that [[Annette Osterwick]] acted like she was open to the idea of working for [[Armando de Majorca]].

## Recap of last session
[[Session 02 - 2022-01-23]]
We met [[Adoracion]] and she gave us some information on [[Armando de Majorca]] and she warned us that he has ties with the second inquisition and a terrible temper. 

After multiple months of planning we finally gave our gift to [[Armando de Majorca]] that was picture mosaic of Madonna the artist that was made of Madonna and child. [[Annette Osterwick]] lied about how long she has been living in [[Granada]] saying about a year. [[Giacomo Fiori]] attempted to just brush off the question about how long he has been there.

[[Cecil Hallward]] met [[Cecilia]] and had a premonition that showed that [[Cecilia]] writing down information about our group of about how long we have been there. 

[[Ada]] attempted to hack into an unnamed network and after failing hid in her van. [[Giacomo Fiori]]'s childer came and to pick her up. They then recovered a tracking device from the van and [[Ada]] put it into a faraday cage.

After the party [[Curro]] wasn't home and [[Cecil Hallward]] called him and said he was on his way home and that [[Cecil Hallward]] childer appears to be missing.
## Log
The group minus [[Ada]] go to [[Cecil Hallward]]'s childer [[Hugo Torres]]'s apartment. There appear to be no signs of struggle from the outside. After [[Hugo Torres]] doesn't answer [[Cecil Hallward]] knocks he unlocks the door with his key. [[Cecil Hallward]] checks [[Hugo Torres]]'s phone but there doesn't appear to be anything out of the ordinary. [[Annette Osterwick]] daunts through all the rooms to make people scared if they are there. [[Giacomo Fiori]] checks the apartment for signs of a struggle in the apartment. 

[[Giacomo Fiori]] notices that the apartment smells like cleaner and that the larger furniture has been moved around based on scratches on the floor. [[Giacomo Fiori]] find a [[Torn Piece of Jeans]] that is had to have been torn by inhuman strength there is a bit of dried blood on the piece of fabric. [[Giacomo Fiori]] also finds a [[Phone Number Note]] and sends it over rat net to [[Ada]]. [[Cecil Hallward]] is able to tell that it is [[Hugo Torres]] handwriting. [[Annette Osterwick]] checks all the jeans in the apartment and can't seem to find any match to the [[Torn Piece of Jeans]]. [[Giacomo Fiori]] finds new blood on the mattress in the guest bedroom and there is an open window but [[Giacomo Fiori]] deduces that this is a red herring. In the master bedroom [[Giacomo Fiori]] finds some bills from last month. Of note [[Giacomo Fiori]] finds an open window and also finds tears in the curtains that appears would be cause by someone attempting to hold onto the curtains while being dragged out of the window. In the bathroom [[Giacomo Fiori]] finds bloody finger prints on the back of the handles of the faucet after and that the sink is tinted slightly pink and appears to been missed in the clean up. [[Cecil Hallward]] checked the blood in the bathroom and it doesn't taste like [[Hugo Torres]] exactly it might be a mix of blood.

It appears that nothing valuable has been taken from the apartment. [[Cecil Hallward]] grabbed [[Hugo Torres]] laptop and phone to give to [[Ada]]. [[Giacomo Fiori]] and [[Cecil Hallward]] check the cabinet in the kitchen that [[Hugo Torres]] keeps his cleaning supplies in. [[Cecil Hallward]] founds a cleaner bottle that they believe to have been held by the person who cleaned the apartment. 

[[Annette Osterwick]] checks out the fire escape and it appears that someone went down the fire escape.

The group checks out [[Hugo Torres]] car and doesn't notice anything out of the ordinary of the about the car. [[Giacomo Fiori]] checks the car for a tracker but doesn't find any sign of a tracker on the car.

[[Cecil Hallward]] has a premonition about [[Hugo Torres]] and sees something along the lines of  lights going overhead every so often. Going bright then dim bright then dim.

[[Ada]] reverse engineers the tracker that was on her van to allow her to transmit false data to the host that is at an ip address in the [[Sacromonte]] area.

[[Ada]] looks up info related to [[Phone Number Note]]. It is the number of an art student that has been in [[Granada]] for the past 3 semesters and nothing suspicious on the surface of the social media account. They emailed [[Hugo Torres]] a few days ago saying that it was nice to meet them and asking about an internship that they had offered to them. [[Ada]] spoofs their phone number to monitor over the next few days.

[[Ada]] checks the surveillance cameras set up at the apartment. They see [[Hugo Torres]] go to his apartment like normal. Then [[Curro]] shows up they seem them act frantic when [[Hugo Torres]] doesn't answer. Scrubbing back future they see 5 people enter [[Hugo Torres Apartment]] they appear to have disable the alarm as it does not go off.  One person is shorter. They don't seem to leave the apartment. But [[Ada]] sees a white van leave after [[Hugo Torres]] enters but it's front plate is obscured from the camera. It appears that the phone that connected and disabled the alarm appears to be a burner.

[[Giacomo Fiori]] went with someone to pull the prints with someone. [[Ada]] checks [[Hugo Torres]] phone and laptop and nothing really stands out about it. [[Cecil Hallward]] goes to feed.

[[Giacomo Fiori]] drinks a blood bag to slake their hunger.

[[Cecil Hallward]] goes to their exhibit to see if Anya student shows up.

[[Annette Osterwick]] sends out their drug dealer acquaintance to scope out junk yards to see if a white van shows up.

[[Ada]] checks up on [[Anya]] and everything is fine on their end.  [[Giacomo Fiori]] checks on their childer and they are fine. [[Annette Osterwick]] checks on their childer and they are fine.

[[Giacomo Fiori]] and [[Ada]] are gonna go talk to [[Adoracion]] about [[Cecilia]]. [[Giacomo Fiori]] is gonna lie to [[Adoracion]] about being interested in the book [[Cecilia]] was reading and that he needs to contact her about that. We wound up saying that we had a premonition that [[Cecilia]] was in danger form [[Armando de Majorca]]. [[Adoracion]] says that she asked [[Cecilia]] to look into us because she was worried about the power balance that could happen if [[Annette Osterwick]] decided to side with [[Armando de Majorca]]. We told [[Adoracion]] the truth and while she was peeved for a second and then lets it slid off and is still worried about [[Cecilia]].

[[Annette Osterwick]] goes to see [[Maram al-Rashid]]. She asks [[Maram al-Rashid]] about [[Cecilia]]. [[Maram al-Rashid]] states that [[Cecilia]]'s sire is part of their court. [[Maram al-Rashid]] doesn't really know the relationship between [[Armando de Majorca]] and [[Cecilia]]. [[Maram al-Rashid]] doesn't really know anything about [[Hugo Torres]] being missing. [[Maram al-Rashid]] also question [[Annette Osterwick]]'s loyalty since she didn't outright refuse [[Armando de Majorca]]'s offer to join their court.
