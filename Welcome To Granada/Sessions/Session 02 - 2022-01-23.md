## Recap of last session
[[Session 01 - 2022-01-09]]
For the first session the Coterie met [[Maram al-Rashid]] in a flash back to 2012. The prince told us to stay away from [[Armando de Majorca]] and as a group we agreed to do that. After a time skip we received [[Letter From Armando]] and after the group discussed with [[Maram al-Rashid]] we decided to give them a terrible gift.

## Log
After a 4 month time skip we meet up at [[Cecil Hallward]] new private studio to discuss what of sort of art piece we are going to give [[Armando de Majorca]]. [[Cecil Hallward]] suggested that we give them a photo of a church with something profane written over it. [[Annette Osterwick]] suggests that we go with something a little more subtle. [[Cecil Hallward]] then suggested something like a digital collage.  [[Giacomo Fiori]] suggests that we make a picture mosaic of a Madonna that is made of smaller Madonnas but to include some that are of the singer Madonna. [[Cecil Hallward]] suggested an animorphs style painting of Jesus turning to bread. [[Cecil Hallward]] suggests a portrait of the Pope but to have [[Armando de Majorca]] to be drinking from the Pope. [[Ada]] suggests that we make a the photo mosaic of the singer Madonna but to make it of Madonna and child. [[Ada]] suggests making an infinite program that as you zoom in on the photo mosaics it converts the smaller photos to photo mosaics forever. We agree on that plan.

A few hours later we meet up at [[Catedral de Garnada]] while there are no real crowds of humans here this late we notice that there a quite a few number of kindred flowing in and out of the [[Catedral de Garnada]]. We are stopped on the way in but allowed in when we say that we are there to see [[Adoracion]]. 

Kindred here are wearing Elysium clothing which strikes us as strange because we had no idea this was a gathering place. A tall woman wearing crimson speaks at the alter and state that she is [[Inconnu]] [[Ventrue]] who is not vying for power and does not want to challenge the power of the [[Maram al-Rashid]] like [[Armando de Majorca]] does. This woman is [[Adoracion]]. She seems surprised to find out that [[Giacomo Fiori]] and [[Ada]] are also [[Inconnu]]. We tell her why we are here but she appears to be annoyed at the mention [[Armando de Majorca]]. She warns us of his temper saying that he is quick to anger but slow to calm down. She lets us know that he is as trough and through a [[Ventrue]] as he comes. [[Adoracion]] is the prince of this area but it is not recognized by anyone in the [[Camarilla]]. [[Cecil Hallward]] asks if they is anything in particular that we should avoid to mention to [[Armando de Majorca]]. [[Adoracion]] states that we should avoid insulting his ego, he thinks that he is on level footing with [[Maram al-Rashid]] but is not but he believes that he is. [[Adoracion]] says that we should treat [[Armando de Majorca]] as threat and the people that don't are the ones that wind up in the hands of the [[Second Inquisition]].

We are now up to present day which is 21-11-4 we received a small note that has the address the to the court of [[Armando de Majorca]] which is [[Seminario Diocesano de Granada]]. In the previous months [[Ada]] bought a van and teched it out for the upcoming events. [[Ada]] gives [[Cecil Hallward]] a flower with a recording transmitter in it so that they can monitor them during seeing [[Armando de Majorca]]. The party is greeted by [[Arlette d'Avignon]] and states that she has been ordered to show the party around. [[Armando de Majorca]] loves the gift. It is given to [[Arlette d'Avignon]] to be stored with the rest of the tributes and to take home. [[Annette Osterwick]] lies and tells [[Armando de Majorca]] that she has only be in town for about a year.

[[Armando de Majorca]] asks if the party sans [[Ada]] would like to join their court so that they can begin to work their way up the ranks. [[Cecil Hallward]] states that he can't be torn away from his art. [[Annette Osterwick]] states that she is still recovering from London and that she isn't saying no but instead deferring a yes. [[Giacomo Fiori]] declines on the basis of his line of work and transient life style would not be suitable for court position. [[Armando de Majorca]] seems most disappointed in [[Giacomo Fiori]] declining than the other two.

[[Armando de Majorca]] called for [[Arlette d'Avignon]] to show the party around the [[Seminario Diocesano de Granada]]. The party is shown a group of humans and [[Arlette d'Avignon]] states that the party is free to feed from any that they like. There is a whole ass shooting range in the basement.

The party splits up to do their own thing [[Cecil Hallward]] and [[Giacomo Fiori]] to go to talk to [[Cecilia]]. [[Cecil Hallward]] got a premonition that Cecilia is going to know who we all are and when we got to the city.

[[Annette Osterwick]] goes to talk to [[Armando de Majorca]] and lies about not knowing [[Maram al-Rashid]]. They then go down to the shooting range and [[Armando de Majorca]] shows [[Annette Osterwick]] how to shoot.

[[Ada]] attempts to hack into an unnamed network and fails twice and it appears that someone is notified of her attempt. [[Ada]] then hides into her subfloor and turns invisible. A guard then comes and check out the van but seems to give up after after it appears that the door is locked.

[[Giacomo Fiori]] childer comes and picks up [[Ada]] and they find a tracking device on the van but [[Ada]] puts it in Faraday cage to isolate the RF signals.

[[Curro]] is on the way home but sounds distressed and head quickly towards the house. [[Curro]] went and got art supplies for [[Cecil Hallward]]'s childer and went to take the art supplies to him but can't seem to find him. He isn't at his house and he isn't answering any form of contacting him.
