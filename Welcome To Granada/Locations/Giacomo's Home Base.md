## Description
![[Giacomo's Home Base.png]]

This unassuming apartment is used as a small home base for [[Giacomo Fiori]]. While he doesn't frequently rest here, it is outfitted with everything he couldn't feasibly stash within his black Fiat Panda. He did manage to secure himself a place with a built-in garage, perfectly hiding his car when he needs it hidden.
